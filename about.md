<p class="message">
  My name is Scott. I'm addicted to all things DevOps, IT, programming, coffee,
  and running. When I was 25 I started a started a consultancy focused on product
  support for the IBM DevOps suite of products.  Four and a half years and one
  hell of a ride later, I've found myself in Melbourne, Australia living yet
  another adventure.
<br /><br />
  I'm an avid NC State Wolfpack fan, of which I proudly hold degrees in both
  Computer Science and Business Management - Finance.
<br /><br />
  I'm passionate about consulting, solving problems, and I prefer to do so in the
  company of good people.
