<p class="message">
  My name is Scott. I'm addicted to all things DevOps, coffee, beer, and running.
  When I was 25 I started a started a consultancy focused on product support for
  the IBM DevOps suite of products.  Four and a half years and one hell of a ride
  later, I've found myself in Melbourne, Australia living yet another adventure.

  I'm an avid NC State Wolfpack fan, of which I proudly hold degrees in both
  Computer Science and Business Management - Finance.

  I'm passionate about consulting, solving problems, and I prefer to do so in the
  company of good people.
  

  Scott is an accomplished DevOps Consultant with more than 10 years' experience in the agile development and continuous delivery space, four years of which have been as a DevOps architect, leading multinational organizations to efficiently adopt DevOps tools and practices. He is now the DevOps delivery manager for Planit Software Testing in Australia, and before that founded and built a successful DevOps consulting company in the USA. A java developer by trade, he is a former IBM developer and a master of integrating new tools and processes with existing development teams.
