Here's the truth - Jenkins/Bamboo/TFS are easy tools to learn and use, Puppet/Chef/Ansible are all pretty easy, spinning up containers is easy, AWS services are meant to be easy to consume...  The difficult part is having the breadth of knowledge required to successfully implement an automated CI/CD pipeline using these tools. <!--more--> And then you need to understand proper software development practices so that what you're building makes sense - i.e. tools and automation are enablers, they magnify bad just as they do good.  And finally, your solution doesn't provide value until its adopted, you must be able to teach.

Let me elaborate. TFS is a great tool for creating automated build pipelines.  But if you don't know the ins and outs of MSBuild, if you don't know what a Nuget package is and how to leverage them in your Visual Studio Solution, knowledge of TFS is only going to get you so far.  If you don't know Java, you don't understand declarative dependency management and you can't create a pom that pulls dependencies from Nexus or Artifactory (of which you setup and configured), knowledge of Jenkins/Bamboo isn't going to help you.

If you aren't a linux wizard, if you don't understand linux security, file/folder permissions, if you don't know how to create and install packages, you don't know what a service is, knowledge of Puppet/Chef/Ansible won't do you much good.

A while back I wrote an obligatory [what is devops post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-10-02-what-is-devops %}), and in that post I made a comment about how DevOps has become commoditized. If you don't believe me, open LinkedIn and search "DevOps".

This simple search returns hundreds of thousands of user profiles. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, it demonstrates the power of the DevOps movement and reassures us that it is a worthwile investment. But now that it has entered the "everybody is doing it stage", the talent pool has become a little frothy with everyone jumping on the bandwagon.

The reality, if you are looking for DevOps talent, is that you need to be careful and ask the right questions. That being said, I can't provie you with a script. You kind of just have to "know".

Here are my thoughts on what makes a good DevOps Consultant.  First, it's important to form two categories - those that understand and can provide guidance on the overall landscape of process change and cultural transformation, and those that are great technologists with knowledge of automation in their respective fields.

If you want to set in a cubicle, focus on checking boxes without concern for whether or not you're building what your client actually needs and then send it over the wall without focus on adoption, you're not adding any value.


### Automation Consultants
As a former developer, i'm biased towards those that have a similar background. Too often DevOps job descriptions list a set of tools.  You'll see n number of variations that look similar to this - Jenkins, Chef/Puppet, Docker, AWS.


Finding a consultant that understands the three pillars of DevOps (People, Process, Tools) is extremely rare. Finding one that
