title: What is DevOps

It seems borderline ridiculous writing a "What is DevOps" post in 2017.  It's been
eight years since the first "DevOpsDays" conference (2009 in Belgium), and even longer
since Patrick Debois coined the term.  But because of the momentum behind the movement,
I feel many of us have succumb to that old Ferris Bueller adage, and are possibly
missing the point...

Every organization with even an ounce of a technical development arm is "looking
into DevOps".  The truth is, the term has been commoditized. And just like our old
friend "Agile", everybody is doing it!

Well, let's get into it.

### Why?

Most IT organizations are structured the same.  At the top of the food chain is a
CIO, with a VP of Operations and a VP of Dev reporting in.  This is where the problem
begins.

Development and Operations are often times at odds with each other.  

#### Operations
Operations' main responsibility is to keep the production systems up and running.
IT is no longer just another avenue for today's businesses to bring in revenue,
more often than not they represent main street.

Since their only objective is to keep production up and running, you guessed it,
that's also how they are measured and compensated.  Too many production incidents,
goodbye Christmas bonus.

So how does Ops view Dev?  Well, they're a risk of course.  Those damn devs put
our system at risk, they're the ones that write buggy code, which makes the system
unstable.  They have no idea what it's like to be "on call" and woken up at 3am on
a Saturday.  They don't get it, I'll just be declining this here Remedy ticket...

#### Development
Development is responsible for building the features and functionality that the
business desires.  The business, talking to customers and evaluating market demand,
delivers a prioritized list of requirements. 

### What?
