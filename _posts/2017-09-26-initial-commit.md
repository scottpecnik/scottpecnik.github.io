Thanks for stopping by.  It's been a while since I've had a personal web page.

Regaining a little personal real estate on the net has been on the bucket list
for quite a while, and it's about time I've finally made it happen.  Things are
still getting up and running, so bear with me as I flesh out the details and
vision over the coming weeks.

Since starting is the hardest part (and in the spirit of Agile), here is my initial commit!

{% highlight bash %}
  git add -A
  git commit -m "Initial Commit"
  git push origin master
{% endhighlight %}
