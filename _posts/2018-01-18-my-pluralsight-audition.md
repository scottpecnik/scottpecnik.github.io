For the past decade or so I've lived by the mantra of "never stop learning".  For me, learning is a passion, or maybe it's an obsession, I'm not really sure.

In the early days of my professional career I helped to build and deliver courses for an IBM product called Rational Business Developer (RBD).  This first foray into teaching likely set the wheels in motion for my future consulting career.

Consulting is to teach, either indirectly or directly.  And throughout my career I've done quite a bit of both.  I approach every engagement with the intention of being hands off the keyboard where possible, I'm there to spread knowledge and experience, not simply augment staff.

When I first discovered [Pluralsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/), I was impressed.  It is the learning platform I once dreamt of building a long time ago.  Naturally, I wanted to contribute by building a course of my own.  Here's my experience going through the audition process...

It's no secret that the content on Pluralsight is quite good.  As one would expect, they don't accept just any author.  In order to be considered you have to *audition*.  To do so, make your way over to [this page](https://www.pluralsight.com/teach) and fill out the application form.  In a couple of days somebody representing the topic you'd like to build content for will reach out and request more info.  They'll ask you things like "what is your experience teaching" and "do you have any experience recording screencasts".  

When I got this email I was excited, I rolled up my sleeves and wrote what I still think is a well thought out response highlighting my experience as a software instructor and teacher.  From the very beginning I treated the audition process as I would a job interview.  But here, pretty much at the beginning, is where things started to go south.  It took exactly 27 days to get a response.  Yep, 27 days.  And that response was to the tune of "hey thanks for your interest, let's setup a time to chat".

At the time I didn't think much of it, people are people and they get busy.  I responded enthusiastically accepting the best available time offered to me (and since at the time I was living in Australia, that was at 5am on a Saturday).  The meeting went well, the acquisition editor assigned to me was a cool guy.  We had a nice talk where he laid out the audition process, answered all of my questions, and then followed up with an email containing more information.

The audition is essentially this...create a video no more than 10 minutes in length that demonstrates your ability to *teach*.  Once completed, if good enough, you work with Pluralsight to come up with a course that fills a gap in their current catalog, and then sign a contract to build it.  My acquisition editor actually offered to personally review the video first before going through the official submission process, which I graciously accepted, and then got to work.

I had a few things on my plate around this time, including a vacation and a long overdue *todo* to create this website.  In a little under a month (24 days to be exact), I sent the first draft of my audition video to my acquisition editor.  He responded with feedback as promised, 15 days later.  His response was that the video was pretty good, but there was room for improvement before officially submitting, of which he provided details.  And that is the last I have heard from Pluralsight.

I fixed up my audition video incorporating the requested changes, sent it back for review, and after exactly four emails over the course of three months, I have never gotten a response.  I'm not sure what to think, my video isn't perfect, but I think is less than terrible and at least deserves a yay or nay.  I have to assume something came up for the acquisition editor...

If you're interested, below is my Pluralsight audition video that never got accepted or rejected.  Let me know what you think.
