Here's the truth - Jenkins/Bamboo/TFS are easy tools to learn and use, Puppet/Chef/Ansible are all pretty easy, spinning up containers is easy, AWS services are meant to be easy to consume...  The difficult part in implementing DevOps automation is having the breadth of knowledge required to successfully leverage these tools. And even that's not enough, because building an automated pipeline without baking in good process just won't cut it.  Tools and automation are enablers, they magnify bad just as they do the good.

If you can figure all of that out, you're close. Next is having the ability to influence cultural change where necessary in order to inspire adoption. This includes training, mentoring, and among other things a general ability to bring people together in order to work towards a shared objective.  After all, your customer sees no value in new automation or processes until they actually use it...

### Automation Consultants

Let me elaborate on the technical side. Jenkins is a fantastic tool, but if you don't know basic java, you don't understand declarative dependency management and you can't create a pom that pulls dependencies from Nexus or Artifactory (of which you setup and configured) - knowledge of these so called "CI" tools isn't going to help you.

If you don't know the ins and outs of MSBuild, if you don't know what a Nuget package is and how to leverage them in your Visual Studio Solution - knowledge of TFS/VSO is only going to get you so far.  

If you aren't a linux wizard, if you don't understand linux security, file/folder permissions, if you don't know how to create and install packages, you don't know what a service is - knowledge of Puppet/Chef/Ansible won't do you much good.

You see, these tools are actually the easy part. They're supposed to be easy, and if you don't know the world around them - and know it well - you'll be stuck having recommended a tool set without the ability to implement beyond a POC.

### DevOps Consultants

What about process change and cultural transformation? This is even harder. If you don't understand proper software development practices, if you've never been on a dev team where you lived and breathed agile, how can you convince someone that your way is the right way? Being able to talk to a CIO about how to structure teams, run projects, and then work with "the doers" to implement is no small feat.

This requires trust and respect from your customer.  These are things that are earned.  They are difficult to get and easy to lose.

### Conclusion

A while back I wrote an obligatory [what is devops post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-10-02-what-is-devops %}), in that post I made a comment about how DevOps has become commoditized. If you don't believe me, open LinkedIn and search "DevOps".

This simple search returns hundreds of thousands of user profiles. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, it demonstrates the power of the DevOps movement and reassures us that it is a worthwile investment. But now that it has entered the "everybody is doing it stage", the talent pool has become a little frothy with everyone jumping on the bandwagon.

The reality, if you are looking for DevOps talent, is that you need to be careful and ask the right questions. That being said, I can't provide you with a script, you just have to "know".

It's important to form two categories - those that understand and can provide guidance on the overall landscape of process change and cultural transformation, and those that are great technologists with automation knowledge in their respective fields.  It's not likely you'll find one person that can fill both shoes, and that's OK.  A separation of duties is actually better in most cases.

As a developer, I'm biased towards those that have a similar background as me. Too often DevOps job descriptions list a set of tools.  You'll see n number of variations that look similar to this:

> Looking for a DevOps consultant.  Must have experience with Git, Jenkins, Chef/Puppet, Docker, AWS.

While that's not a bad place to start, give me a developer any day. Somebody that is a successful coder, to me that is more valuable than knowing how to click buttons in a web interface.  And more than likely a coder has lived and breathed agile.

At the end of the day, what I look for most is somebody that has the **ability to learn**. If they are ambitious, a self-starter, and i'm confident they can pick up a new tool or technology quickly.  You are hired, because you are rare.
